        The following charts visualize the relationship between indicators coming from various segments of society. In all cases, higher scores show greater democracy and lower scores show greater autocracy. Additionally, the thickness of each line measures the relationship between this indicator and EDI, with a thicker line showing a higher EDI score. This information can be used to examine which factors in a given country are most strongly related to the erosion of democracy.

    <h2>Political Corruption</h2>
    <p>Each of the three corruption indicators is a measure of the extent to which elected officials can be bribed or influenced to by outside forces. Constitutional respect measures the degree to which the members of the executive branch respect and adhere to the constitution.</p>
    <h2>Power Balance in Government</h2>
    <p>This chart demonstrates to what degree a government has placed adequate and effective systems of checks and balances on itself. Legislative and judicial constraints on the executive refer to these institutions’ ability to curb the power of the country’s leader, while government accountability measures the extent to which various bodies can demand information, interrogate officials, and punish improper behavior.</p>
    <h2>Political Equality</h2>
    <p>Socioeconomic equality measures the share of political power held by different income brackets, lower scores indicate a greater concentration of power in the hands of the wealthy. Gender inequality quantifies the same idea, but in this case a higher score shows greater political power for both genders, while a low score demonstrates power concentration in the hands of men. Health and education equality refer to the guarantee of high-quality learning and medical opportunities for all segments of the populace. </p>
    <h2>Media</h2>
    <p>To what extent does the government interfere with the media? Government censorship and journalist harassment evaluate interference in press freedoms, while media self-censorship is a calculation of the degree to which the media prevents its own members from reporting diverse perspectives on politically sensitive issues. Media criticism is the opposite, measuring the amount of media outlets that regularly criticize the government.
