        <h1>Measuring Democracy</h1>
        <p>
        This chart shows the change in electoral democracy over time. 
        This index is a measure of polyarchy, literally “rule of many,” or the response of the government 
        to the needs of its citizens and their role as political equals. 
        A higher score indicates greater polyarchy, while a lower score indicates greater autocracy (a system of government 
        where one person rules with absolute power).

            <h2 id="edi">What is the Electoral Democracy Index (EDI)? </h2>
            <p>
                The Electoral Democracy Index is the conglomeration of five high-level indices that measure the degree to which a country attains the core values of democracy: where rulers are accountable to their citizens; elections are held regularly, openly, and fairly for majority approval; the right to vote is widespread; and political parties and civil societies are able to operate free from government interference. In a fully functioning democracy, citizens enjoy freedom of expression publicly and privately and benefit from an independent media that presents diverse viewpoints on political issues.
                
                In V-Dem, EDI is the foundational element of all five major indices, and the truest indicator of representative democracy in the data set.
            </p>
            <h3>COMPONENTS</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Freedom of association</b> refers to the ability of the citizenry to collectively and independently organize into political parties and civil societies to take part in the democratic process, and also the extent to which elections are multiparty. 
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Freedom of expression</b> measures the extent to which the government respects press and media freedom, the freedom of academic discourse regarding political issues, and the freedom of ordinary citizens to discuss political issues both at home and in the public sphere.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Voting rights</b> indicates the share of the population that is allowed to vote in general elections. It aggregates scores for suffrage for social groups, genders, and economic groups. 
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Clean elections</b> is a measure of electoral transparency, freedom from corruption, and fairness. This indicator is derived by measuring variables such as vote buying, government interference in the electoral process, and the autonomy of election boards.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Elected officials</b> is a representation of the extent to which officials are appointed to office through a democratic process. This measure can be skewed by sham elections and elections in which there is only one option, and so should not necessarily always be considered a solid measurement of democracy.
