    <h1>About the Data</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/">Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)</a> is a social science data set collected and managed by the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. This research is founded on the concept of democracy as going beyond the mere presence or absence of elections. V-Dem is designed to conceptualize and measure democracy in a multidimensional way. The set contains over 450 indicators that are grouped hierarchically into five high-level indices. Indicators measure topics as diverse as media censorship, judicial independence,socioeconomic inequality, corruption, and hundreds of other aspects affecting democracy. Overall, there are more than 19 million data points. We used <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/data/data-version-9/">version 9 of the Varieties of Democracy dataset</a>. 
        <br />
        Data is collected by over 50 social scientists working with more than 3,000 country experts. Each low-level indicator is scored by five experts for each country, whose scores are then averaged and weighted to produce a single value for a single indicator in a single year. These low-level indicators are combined through algorithms to produce mid-level indicators, which in turn are aggregated into the five high-level indicators.
        <br />
        The set covers 202 countries and contains data from 1789 to today, where possible.

    <h1>About this Project</h1> 
    <p>
     This project was created at the University of Washington for Human-Centered Design and Engineering's Information Visualization class. 
     The collaborators on this project were Megan Brown, <a href="http://sms.design/">Samantha Muscat-Scherr</a>, Camila Proffitt, Ellen Reed, and Spencer Wilkerson. 
     This project sets out to explore the erosion of democracy around the world. We are now experiencing the third wave of autocratization in the modern era. In 2019, almost one third of people in the world live in countries that are experiencing democratic erosion, many of them with powerful economies and significant global influence, such as India, Brazil, and the United States. The first wave, 1922 to 1942, ended in a world war. The second wave, 1960 to 1975, saw the rise of authoritarian regimes around the world, followed by massive increases in political violence. It is our hope that, by studying democracy and the factors that contribute to its decline, we can reverse the tide and prevent a similar fate befalling us a third time.
     
     Uniquely, this third wave of democratic erosion is affecting primarily liberal democracies. Whereas the first two waves were characterized largely by sudden episodes, such as coups, invasions, or dictators seizing power, the third wave is largely happening more gradually and insidiously under a facade of legitimacy. Leaders are swept to power through normal elections, and then seek to undermine and chip away at the democratic institutions in their country without abolishing them outright. 
     
     As we face increasing social polarization through social media, disinformation, and government manipulation of media, it is important to remember that  the share of democracies in the world is near the highest itâ€™s ever been, at greater than 50%. Democratization is still occurring in many parts of the world, and it is still early enough to make a change. 
     
     Our data is displayed so that you may explore and compare countries across multiple indicators and reach your own conclusions. While it is outside the scope of this project to provide social context for every country, we encourage people to investigate our data and supplement with their own research.

    <h1>What are Electoral Democracy Indicators (EDI)? </h1>
    <p>
            The Electoral Democracy Index is one of five high-level indices that measures the degree to which a country attains the core values of democracy: where rulers are accountable to their citizens; elections are held regular, openly, and fairly for majority approval; the right to vote is widespread; and political parties and civil societies are able to operate free from government interference. Further, citizens enjoy freedom of expression publicly and privately and an independent media that presents diverse viewpoints on political issues.
            
            In V-Dem, EDI is the foundational element of all five major indices, and the truest indicator of representative democracy in the data set.
            
            Components
            
            Freedom of association refers to the ability of the citizenry to collectively and independently organize into political parties and civil societies to take part in the democratic process, and also the extent to which elections are multiparty. 
            
            Freedom of expression measures the extent to which the government respects press and media freedom, the freedom of academic discourse regarding political issues, and the freedom of ordinary citizens to discuss political issues both at home and in the public sphere.
            
            Voting rights indicates the share of the population that is allowed to vote in general elections. It aggregates scores for suffrage for social groups, genders, and economic groups. 
            
            Clean elections is a measure of electoral transparency, freedom from corruption, and fairness. This indicator is derived by measuring variables such as vote buying, government interference in the electoral process, and the autonomy of election boards.
            
            Elected officials is a representation of the extent to which officials are appointed to office through a democratic process such as elections. This measure can be skewed by sham elections and elections in which there is only one option, and so should not necessarily always be considered a solid measurement of democracy.
